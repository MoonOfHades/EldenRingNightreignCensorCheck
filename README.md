# EldenRingNightreignNameChecker (Currently In Development)
Name censor checker for Elden Ring Nightreign (and base Elden Ring) made to help players check if their funny name will make it past Fromsoft's [Scunthorpe Problem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scunthorpe_problem)-ridden approach to censoring inappropriate in-game names. Why can't I name myself "Crucible Knight"? Why do I have to wait to see a victor's record to find out that it was censored this entire time?

If you like this tool, please [send me a Grass Crest Shield](https://ko-fi.com/sir_ansbach) for my aging bones.
